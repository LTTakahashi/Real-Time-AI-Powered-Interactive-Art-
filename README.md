# GestureCanvas - AI-Powered Interactive Art

![GestureCanvas Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=GestureCanvas+AI+Art)

**GestureCanvas** is a real-time, gesture-controlled digital art application that transforms hand-drawn sketches into professional-quality artwork using Generative AI (Stable Diffusion).

Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Gradio, it offers a seamless "magical" experience where your hand movements in the air become digital art on the screen.

## 🚀 Features

- **👋 Hand Tracking & Gestures**: Draw in the air using natural hand movements.
- **🎨 Real-Time Canvas**: Smooth, high-quality drawing with Catmull-Rom spline interpolation.
- **✨ AI Style Transfer**: Transform sketches into Photorealistic, Anime, Oil Painting, and more using SDXL-Turbo.
- **⚡ High Performance**: 30 FPS tracking, <2s generation, optimized with threading and dirty rectangle rendering.
- **🖥️ Interactive UI**: Complete web interface with webcam streaming, gesture feedback, and calibration.

## 🏗️ Architecture

GestureCanvas uses a multi-threaded architecture for maximum performance:

1. **Hand Tracking Thread**: Captures webcam frames and processes MediaPipe landmarks (30 FPS).
2. **Main Thread**: Handles UI event loop, canvas rendering, and user interaction.
3. **Generation Thread**: Processes Stable Diffusion requests asynchronously to prevent UI freezing.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design.
